Today I learned a lot about HTML. What really amazed me was how the internet was based off of this simple thing called HTML. Now everything runs off of it. Even major companys like google use it. HTML shows what computers can do to transform society. These machines can either allow humans to work at their top teir, or make humans turn their backs on other humans. What I also learned today was how to create my own website for free on GitHub. The whole process depends on the foundation of HTML to run a website.

Context

For the past few days I have learned a few things about coding.
For starters, I learned about the bianary system and was given context about the doubling of 2-4-8-ext, system.
This is a way to count binary and spell in binary. I also learned a few things about cpu's,ram, and also the storage.
This allowed me to understand how people erassed data from storage because there are little holes on a disk that are actual cod for 0 and 1. 
Using the magnet makes all the data go to 0, thus currupting the data and making it reset. Then I learned what ram did. What it does is temperairly stores 
data and allows increased performance on a computer, but when the computer is turned off, the data is erased within the ram stick.
I also learned a few things about VPN's and hacking. VPN's allow a safer way to access wifi/the internet without being detected. In Saint Johns currently most VPN's are banned.
