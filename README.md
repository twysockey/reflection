For the last week I have been having trouble with coding in a few areas, most of of troubles are memory issues. This problem can be fixed by taking notes and adding on to Mr.Golds cheat sheet,but when taking tests It wont be allowed to be used because of the fact its cheating. So a way I could get fimilar with some of the codes is by using them more commonly, but the problem with that solution is that there are limitless amounts of code within coding programs.

What I have learned so far in class this week I have learned a few things. I learned how to create a folder within a folder within putty. I also learned how to make a file with coding, but I'm very confused on the process of it. When seeing this stuff it looks very odd to me, yet vaguely familiar. Coming from ops has allowed me to understand some of the codings that we the class are going to do, but at the same time, there are codes that I have no clue with.
