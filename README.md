Today was pretty interresting. In class Mr.Gold wanted the students to create a game by our selves. He provided us with very bane boned codes and had us start fiddling around with it. I was able to change the color of the back round to a blue, to make it look like a sky. I was able to change the ground to green and have a human within the game and made him black. So I have modded the games colors, but now im trying to add functions like jump, music and add a backround thats in 4k. I tried researching how to generate terain like in minecraft, but its very complicated for how much I understand. Tonight Ill try to finish a few lessons in code academy and try to do more in my project.

Today was really good! I was able to have a better understanding with the int function and was able to get some more context on the string function. It so far has allowed me to understand python/coding in a better light. Tonight Ill be practicing on code academy and try to review some of the tools.

{Review)On this day I was rather negetitive. I was being rude and unpleasant for which I didn't allow myself to learn anything. What I did do though is find a better way to communicate with mr.gold and found a website to help me to code with.

Coding today was a mix of things. On one hand I was so close to almost getting a grasp on a problem, but on the other hand I didn't achieve in completing that problem. Today I learned that fiber optic cables can bline people if you cut it infront of people.

When coding today it was interesting. For the first portion of the class I was able to achieve a fair amount by myself. I was able to convert military time into civilian time after fiddling around with the codes for a little bit. Then our class was taught about looping. Though not being able to achieve it yet, I understand the concept. It allows the process of countining a string of words or sentences but without the process of tons of code.

Today much progress has happened. I was able to learn stuff I didn't have much grasp with. I sturggled in the beginning of class and gave Mr.Gold a hard time,but I was able to manage myself later in the class and accept the help from Mr.Gold to actually countinue forward with the class. I know have a better understanding of STR- this is a string which is helpful for connecting commands and other codes together. In the future I should ask Mr.Gold queastions because of how coding is so new to me. I cant be fed the answers, but what I can do is ask queastions. Ill make sure from now on to ask more queastions to improve and move forward in his class.

Today was a long day. For most of the day I spent my time researching again on how to make my text move everytime I touch the keyboard. I lost steam halfway through after doing two days of research that hasn't resulted in getting anyware. I haven't really learned anything today because of how tired I am at the moment. Tomorrow, my hope is that I might be able to find this "text" that might give me extra credit, but other than that im most likely calling quits.

Today I was able to fix my problem on line ten when coding. After spending ten mins on it I figured out I had to add an + to it in order to solve it. I also learned todau that how to create lists in code. Or lists within lists. That sorta thing, I guess. Anyways I had difficulty with that and Im trying to understand how to do it. The process of making a list is supposedly the same as what Im doing in the Pokeman project.

Today I was able to organize my coding with variables. This allows me specify where I put certain codes. I also learned how to use print correctly and how to fix my coding mistakes more easily without anybodys help. Im still trying to learn how to place images as a text and how to have my text roll to the right, but other than that I learned a lot today. *dab

So far I have been able to complete a small portion of coding today. Im very confused on wether or not Im doing coding correctly, but I try to manage. What Im going to do for the project is use the same process of ask and answer with the terminal that we were doing today and try and go from there. So for example, If I type my name name, Ill have the terminal respond with content/ a back story of pokeman. Thus allowing the program to be interactive. I just then have to make sure when it asks for somebodys name or a response it will be an intelligent one. So that will be the foundation of my project.

Today I have been able to complete a portion of my website. I have been able to connect 2/3's of my website with in the website and I have been able to change a few colors as well. I have put memes on one page and a "about me" on another page. Im still trying to create ideas for what I should write about, but time is coming to a close because of the deadlines. I will most likely finish this project by tonight. I felt that I didn't put enough effort into the website so far. I think If I try harder next time then maybe I will do more.

Today I have really done nothing. I started fiddling around with html and try to form a website. I put photos and typed words into code, but it didn't add depth or make it interesting to the average person. I had to restart because of the lack of progress and now have a solid foundation for my project. The things I have learned today was more about how to specify code further and try to do more work independantly.

Today I learned a lot about HTML. What really amazed me was how the internet was based off of this simple thing called HTML. Now everything runs off of it. Even major companys like google use it. HTML shows what computers can do to transform society. These machines can either allow humans to work at their top teir, or make humans turn their backs on other humans. What I also learned today was how to create my own website for free on GitHub. The whole process depends on the foundation of HTML to run a website.

Context

For the past few days I have learned a few things about coding.
For starters, I learned about the bianary system and was given context about the doubling of 2-4-8-ext, system.
This is a way to count binary and spell in binary. I also learned a few things about cpu's,ram, and also the storage.
This allowed me to understand how people erassed data from storage because there are little holes on a disk that are actual cod for 0 and 1. 
Using the magnet makes all the data go to 0, thus currupting the data and making it reset. Then I learned what ram did. What it does is temperairly stores 
data and allows increased performance on a computer, but when the computer is turned off, the data is erased within the ram stick.
I also learned a few things about VPN's and hacking. VPN's allow a safer way to access wifi/the internet without being detected. In Saint Johns currently most VPN's are banned.
