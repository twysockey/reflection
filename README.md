Reflection 1 
1/26/2018

What I have learned so far in class this week I have learned a few things. I learned how to create a folder within a folder within putty. I also learned how to make a file with coding, but I'm very confused on the process of it. When seeing this stuff it looks very odd to me, yet vaguely familiar. Coming from ops has allowed me to understand some of the codings that we the class are going to do, but at the same time, there are codes that I have no clue with.
