After Mr.Gold declined my song requeast I started to have a minor flashback, but with that said it wasn't so bad. This week has been really difficult for me homework wise and grade wise. My grade has been stagnating and has not improved. For homework I have not really progressed to a point where I would like to be at. I was researching code for three days that might help me figure out how to do the Soduko homework, but my efforts resulted being futile because of either the code not working/syntax errors. I had the same problem with the other homeworks, but I atleast was able to finish a portion of the homework. This work I had to restart a multitude of times by removing the file and making a new one. It was only one day ago when I tried to do the bowling project. I have had more progress with understanding how to code with the bowling project than with the soduko. I know two  individuals in this class not knowing what they are doing and completely lost in what they are trying to do.

After being roasted this week by most of my classmates I have finally been able to finish 2 homework projects out of the three. It was painfully difficult to find code that worked. It also was difficult to understand how to use raw_Input. I believe that most of my difficulties for each homework project has been due to the fact that I really don’t know much of the functions of the code, nor do I know how to properly place each individual code. I see that I can fix this problem by having a cheat sheet on me when coding, but when taking tests I assume that I won’t be able to use it.

For homework this week it has been difficult. I have felt that with my grades declining in this class I would've been working harder on trying to achieve my goal of raising grades to only have the opposit to occur. With the stress of grades in this class and the stress of my G.P.A declining my brain feels over whelmed. I set out my google friday to be where I make a program where you can have the terminal diagnose you based on asking a few queastions, but with wanting to do so I didn't know where to start and felt ultimately useless. My code didn't work and it made me just restart the night prior to having the class turn in there projects. Ultimately, me coming to tutorial isn't helping enough. I believe the case to be made is that I dont ask enough queastions, yet when trying to I feel more obligated to try coding myself without any help or assistents.

This week was a great week for coding. I made a madlib that was based off the russian findings of Hitlers bunker and made it really silly. What I also did this week was finish the first and parts of the second homework. I found that the code used for the second homework though will ultimately fail because of the lack of therfore code and also the I keep facing the problem of the program working and not working. So I keep trying to add on to the original code that works but only parts of it work.

This week I have felt very acommplished when it came to coding compared to previous weeks. This week I made use of the command "input" in order to start the last homework problem. With input I used to allow the user to pick any number they wanted and it would solve the 3 problems given to them. I also was able use old code from summer ops to help me in this process. For fridays up coming project Omar came up with a idea for a website. The idea is to categorize each class on a personal difficulty level from least to greatest and to then organize each class on a time based level. The idea would use multiple input functions.

For the last week I have been having trouble with coding in a few areas, most of of troubles are memory issues. This problem can be fixed by taking notes and adding on to Mr.Golds cheat sheet,but when taking tests It wont be allowed to be used because of the fact its cheating. So a way I could get fimilar with some of the codes is by using them more commonly, but the problem with that solution is that there are limitless amounts of code within coding programs.

What I have learned so far in class this week I have learned a few things. I learned how to create a folder within a folder within putty. I also learned how to make a file with coding, but I'm very confused on the process of it. When seeing this stuff it looks very odd to me, yet vaguely familiar. Coming from ops has allowed me to understand some of the codings that we the class are going to do, but at the same time, there are codes that I have no clue with.
