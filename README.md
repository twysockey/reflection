Today I was able to organize my coding with variables. This allows me specify where I put certain codes. I also learned how to use print correctly and how to fix my coding mistakes more easily without anybodys help. Im still trying to learn how to place images as a text and how to have my text roll to the right, but other than that I learned a lot today. *dab

So far I have been able to complete a small portion of coding today. Im very confused on wether or not Im doing coding correctly, but I try to manage. What Im going to do for the project is use the same process of ask and answer with the terminal that we were doing today and try and go from there. So for example, If I type my name name, Ill have the terminal respond with content/ a back story of pokeman. Thus allowing the program to be interactive. I just then have to make sure when it asks for somebodys name or a response it will be an intelligent one. So that will be the foundation of my project.

Today I have been able to complete a portion of my website. I have been able to connect 2/3's of my website with in the website and I have been able to change a few colors as well. I have put memes on one page and a "about me" on another page. Im still trying to create ideas for what I should write about, but time is coming to a close because of the deadlines. I will most likely finish this project by tonight. I felt that I didn't put enough effort into the website so far. I think If I try harder next time then maybe I will do more.

Today I have really done nothing. I started fiddling around with html and try to form a website. I put photos and typed words into code, but it didn't add depth or make it interesting to the average person. I had to restart because of the lack of progress and now have a solid foundation for my project. The things I have learned today was more about how to specify code further and try to do more work independantly.

Today I learned a lot about HTML. What really amazed me was how the internet was based off of this simple thing called HTML. Now everything runs off of it. Even major companys like google use it. HTML shows what computers can do to transform society. These machines can either allow humans to work at their top teir, or make humans turn their backs on other humans. What I also learned today was how to create my own website for free on GitHub. The whole process depends on the foundation of HTML to run a website.

Context

For the past few days I have learned a few things about coding.
For starters, I learned about the bianary system and was given context about the doubling of 2-4-8-ext, system.
This is a way to count binary and spell in binary. I also learned a few things about cpu's,ram, and also the storage.
This allowed me to understand how people erassed data from storage because there are little holes on a disk that are actual cod for 0 and 1. 
Using the magnet makes all the data go to 0, thus currupting the data and making it reset. Then I learned what ram did. What it does is temperairly stores 
data and allows increased performance on a computer, but when the computer is turned off, the data is erased within the ram stick.
I also learned a few things about VPN's and hacking. VPN's allow a safer way to access wifi/the internet without being detected. In Saint Johns currently most VPN's are banned.
