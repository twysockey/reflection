Context

For the past few days I have learned a few things about coding.
For starters, I learned about the bianary system and was given context about the doubling of 2-4-8-ext, system.
This is a way to count binary and spell in binary. I also learned a few things about cpu's,ram, and also the storage.
This allowed me to understand how people erassed data from storage because there are little holes on a disk that are actual cod for 0 and 1. 
Using the magnet makes all the data go to 0, thus currupting the data and making it reset. Then I learned what ram did. What it does is temperairly stores 
data and allows increased performance on a computer, but when the computer is turned off, the data is erased within the ram stick.
I also learned a few things about VPN's and hacking. VPN's allow a safer way to access wifi/the internet without being detected. In Saint Johns currently most VPN's are banned.
